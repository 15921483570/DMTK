Please open issues in the project below. For any technical support email to [dmtk@microsoft.com](mailto:dmtk@microsoft.com)

DMTK includes the following projects:
* [DMTK framework(Multiverso)](https://github.com/Microsoft/multiverso): The parameter server framework for distributed machine learning.
* [LightLDA](https://github.com/Microsoft/lightlda): Scalable, fast and lightweight system for large-scale topic modeling.
* [LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/lightGBM): LightGBM is a fast, distributed, high performance gradient boosting (GBDT, GBRT, GBM or MART) framework based on decision tree algorithms, used for ranking, classification and many other machine learning tasks. 
* [Distributed word embedding](https://github.com/Microsoft/multiverso/tree/master/Applications/WordEmbedding): Distributed algorithm for word embedding implemented on multiverso.

* [Distributed word embedding(deprecated)](https://github.com/Microsoft/distributed_word_embedding): Distributed algorithm for word embedding.
* [Distributed skipgram mixture(deprecated)](https://github.com/Microsoft/distributed_skipgram_mixture): Distributed algorithm for multi-sense word embedding. 


# Updates
## 2016-10-17 
* [LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/lightGBM) has been released. which is a fast, distributed, high performance gradient boosting (GBDT, GBRT, GBM or MART) framework based on decision tree algorithms, used for ranking, classification and many other machine learning tasks. 

## 2016-09-12
* A talk on the latest updates of DMTK is presented on [GTC China](http://www.gputechconf.cn/page/home.html). We also described the latest research work from our team, including the lightRNN(to be appeared in NIPS2016) and [DC-ASGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08326). 

## 2016-07-05 
* Multiverso has been upgrade to new API.[Overview](https://github.com/Microsoft/multiverso/wiki/Overview)
* Deep learning framework ([torch](https://github.com/Microsoft/multiverso/wiki/Multiverso-Torch-Binding-Benchmark)/[theano](https://github.com/Microsoft/multiverso/wiki/Multiverso-Python-Binding-Benchmark)) support has been added.
* Python/Lua bidding has been supported, you can using multiverso with [Python](https://github.com/Microsoft/multiverso/wiki/Multiverso-Python-Theano-Lasagne-Binding)/[Lua](https://github.com/Microsoft/multiverso/wiki/Multiverso-Torch-Lua-Binding).
